        <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
        <h4>Introduction and Overview</h4>
        <p>We have drafted this privacy policy (version 01.12.2021-311891618)
          to explain to you in accordance with the requirements of the
          <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&tid=311891618">General Data
            Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a>
          and applicable national laws, what personal data (in short, data)
          we as controllers – and those processors commissioned by us (e.g., providers)
          – process, will process in the future, and what lawful options you have.
          The terms used are to be understood in a gender-neutral manner.
        </p>
        <p><b>In short:</b> We comprehensively inform you about the data we process about you.</p>
        <p>Privacy statements usually sound very technical and use legal jargon.
          This privacy policy, on the other hand, is intended to describe the most
          important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. To promote
          transparency, technical terms are explained in a user-friendly manner, links
          to further information are provided, and graphics are used. We therefore
          inform in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in
          the course of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis.
          This is certainly not possible when providing as brief, unclear, and legally
          technical explanations as are often the standard on the internet when it comes
          to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting
          and informative, and perhaps there's some information you didn't know before.</p>
        <p>If you still have questions, we ask you to contact the responsible party
          mentioned below or in the imprint, follow the existing links, and view further
          information on third-party sites. Of course, you can also find our contact
          details in the imprint.</p>


        <h4>Scope of Application</h4>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by us within the company and for all personal data
          processed by companies (processors) commissioned by us. By personal data, we mean information as defined in
          Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as a person's name, email address, and postal address. Processing personal data
          enables us to offer and bill our services and products, be it online or offline. The scope of this privacy
          policy includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>
          <li>social media appearances and email communication</li>
          <li>mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short: The privacy policy applies to all areas where personal data is processed structuredly within the
          company via the mentioned channels. Should we enter into legal relations with you outside of these channels,
          we will inform you separately, if necessary.</p>

        <h4>Legal Bases</h4>
        <p>In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information about the legal principles and
          regulations, that is, the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which allow us to process
          personal data.</p>
        <p>As for EU law, we refer to the REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL dated
          27 April 2016. Of course, you can read this General Data Protection Regulation of the EU online at EUR-Lex,
          the gateway to EU law, at <a
            href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.
        </p>
        <p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Consent</b> (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific
            purpose. An example would be the storage of data you entered in a contact form.</li>
          <li><b>Contract</b> (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR): To fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you, we
            process your data. For instance, if we conclude a purchase contract with you, we require certain personal
            information beforehand.</li>
          <li><b>Legal Obligation</b> (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we process your
            data. For example, we are legally required to retain invoices for accounting purposes. These usually contain
            personal data.</li>
          <li><b>Legitimate Interests</b> (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR): In the event of legitimate interests that do not
            restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we need to
            process certain data to operate our website securely and economically efficiently. This processing is thus a
            legitimate interest.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other conditions such as public interest tasks and the exercise of public authority as well as the protection
          of vital interests generally do not apply to us. If such a legal basis should nevertheless be relevant, it
          will be indicated at the appropriate place.</p>
        <p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In Austria, this is the Federal Law on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of
            Personal Data (Data Protection Act), abbreviated DSG.</li>
          <li>In Germany, the Federal Data Protection Act, abbreviated BDSG, applies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.</p>


        <h4>Contact Details of the Responsible Party</h4>

          Phone: +49 30 450 580 016</p>

        <h4>Storage Duration</h4>
        <p>As a general criterion for us, we only store personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary to provide
          our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for processing it no
          longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to keep certain data even after the original purpose has
          ceased, for example, for accounting purposes.</p>
        <p>If you wish to have your data deleted or revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as
          quickly as possible, as long as there is no obligation to retain it.</p>
        <p>We will provide information on the specific duration of the respective data processing further below, as long
          as we have more details on that.</p>


        <h4>Rights according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h4>
        <p>According to Article 13 of the GDPR, you are entitled to the following rights to ensure fair and transparent
          processing of data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>According to Article 15 of the GDPR, you have the right to inquire if we are processing your data. If this
            is the case, you are entitled to receive a copy of the data and learn the following information:
            <ul>
              <li>the purposes for which we process the data;</li>
              <li>the categories, meaning the types of data that are processed;</li>
              <li>who receives this data and if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be ensured;
              </li>
              <li>how long the data is stored;</li>
              <li>the existence of the right to rectification, deletion, or restriction of processing and the right to
                object to the processing;</li>
              <li>that you can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found
                below);</li>
              <li>the source of the data if we did not collect it from you;</li>
              <li>whether profiling is conducted, meaning if data is automatically evaluated to create a personal
                profile about you.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>According to Article 16 of the GDPR, you have the right to rectification, meaning we must correct data if
            you find errors.</li>
          <li>According to Article 17 of the GDPR, you have the right to deletion (or the "right to be forgotten"),
            which specifically means you can demand the deletion of your data.</li>
          <li>According to Article 18 of the GDPR, you have the right to restrict processing, meaning we can only store
            but not further use the data.</li>
          <li>According to Article 19 of the GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means we must provide
            your data in a common format upon request.</li>
          <li>According to Article 21 of the GDPR, you have the right to object, which, if enforced, leads to a change
            in the processing.
            <ul>
              <li>If the processing of your data is based on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest, exercise of public
                authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interest), you can object to the processing. We will then
                promptly check whether we can legally comply with this objection.</li>
              <li>If data is used for direct advertising, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We
                must then no longer use your data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
              <li>If data is used for profiling, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We must
                then no longer use your data for profiling.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>In some cases, according to Article 22 of the GDPR, you have the right not to be subjected to a decision
            based solely on automated processing (e.g., profiling).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>In short:</b> You have rights - do not hesitate to contact the responsible body listed above!</p>
        <p>If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection laws or your data protection rights
          have been violated in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. For Austria,
          this is the Data Protection Authority, which you can find at <a
            href="https://www.dsb.gv.at/">https://www.dsb.gv.at/</a>. In Germany, each federal state has a data
          protection commissioner. For more information, you can contact the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection
          and Freedom of Information (BfDI). The following local data protection authority is responsible for our
          company:</p>

        <p>Affected: Website visitors<br>
          Purpose: Depends on the specific cookie. More details can be found below or from the software manufacturer
          that sets the cookie.<br>
          Processed data: Depends on the cookie in use. More details can be found below or from the software

        <h4>What are Cookies?</h4>
        <p>Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data.<br>
          Below, we explain what cookies are and why they are used to help you better understand the following privacy
          policy.</p>
        <p>Whenever you surf the internet, you use a browser. Common browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet
          Explorer, and Microsoft Edge. Most websites save small text files in your browser. These files are called
          cookies.</p>
        <p>One thing is clear: cookies are really useful helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. More specifically,
          these are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for different applications. HTTP cookies are small
          files saved by our website on your computer. These cookie files are automatically placed in the cookie folder,
          essentially the "brain" of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Additionally, one or more
          attributes must be specified when defining a cookie.</p>
        <p>Cookies store certain user data, such as language or personal page settings. When you return to our site,
          your browser sends back the “user-related” information to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website recognizes
          who you are and provides you with the settings you are accustomed to. In some browsers, each cookie has its
          own file; in others, like Firefox, all cookies are stored in a single file.</p>
        <p>There are first-party cookies as well as third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our
          site, while third-party cookies are created by partner sites (e.g., Google Analytics). Each cookie must be
          assessed individually since each one stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies,
          ranging from a few minutes to several years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses,
          Trojans, or other "malware." Cookies also cannot access information on your PC.</p>
        <p>An example of cookie data might look like this:</p>
        <p><b>Name:</b> _ga<br>
          <b>Value:</b> GA1.2.1326744211.152311891618-9<br>
          <b>Purpose:</b> Differentiating website visitors<br>
          <b>Expiration:</b> After 2 years
        </p>
        <p>Here are the minimum sizes a browser should be able to support:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
          <li>At least 50 cookies per domain</li>
          <li>At least 3000 cookies in total</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Which Types of Cookies Exist?</h4>
        <p>The specific cookies we use depends on the services we utilize, which will be clarified in the following
          sections of the privacy statement. At this point, we'd like to briefly discuss the different types of HTTP
          cookies.</p>

        <p>There are 4 types of cookies to distinguish:</p>

        <p><b>Essential Cookies</b><br>
          These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic functions of the website. For example, these cookies are

          <b>Functional Cookies</b><br>
          These cookies collect information about user behavior and whether the user receives any error messages.
          Additionally, using these cookies, the loading time and behavior of the website across different browsers is
          measured.
          <br><br>
          <b>Targeted Cookies</b><br>
          These cookies enhance user-friendliness. For example, entered locations, font sizes, or form data are saved.
          <br><br>
          <b>Advertising Cookies</b><br>
          These cookies are also called targeting cookies. Their purpose is to deliver individually tailored advertising
          to the user. This can be very convenient, but also very annoying.
        </p>
        <p>Usually, when visiting a website for the first time, you will be asked which of these cookie types you wish
          to accept. And of course, this decision is also stored in a cookie.</p>
        <p>If you want to know more about cookies and aren't deterred by technical documentation, we recommend <a
            href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments
          by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called "HTTP State Management Mechanism".</p>

        <h4>Purpose of processing via cookies</h4>
        <p>The purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. More details on this can be found below or from the
          software manufacturer that sets the cookie.</p>

        <h4>What data is processed?</h4>
        <p>Cookies are small assistants for a variety of tasks. It's not possible to generalize what data is stored in
          cookies, but we will inform you about the processed or saved data in the following privacy policy.</p>

        <h4>Storage duration of cookies</h4>
        <p>The storage duration depends on the respective cookie and is specified further below. Some cookies are
          deleted after less than an hour, while others can remain stored on a computer for several years.</p>
        <p>You also have influence over the storage duration. You can manually delete all cookies at any time via your
          browser (see also below "Right to object"). Furthermore, cookies that are based on consent are deleted at the
          latest after you revoke your consent, but the legality of the storage remains unaffected until then.</p>

        <h4>Right to object - How can I delete cookies?</h4>
        <p>Whether and how you want to use cookies is up to you. Regardless of which service or website the cookies come
          from, you always have the option to delete, deactivate, or only partially allow cookies. For example, you can
          block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.</p>
        <p>If you want to find out which cookies have been stored in your browser, or if you want to change or delete
          cookie settings, you can find this in your browser settings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=de" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome</a></li>
          <li><strong>Safari:</strong> <a href="https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage cookies and website data with Safari</a></li>
          <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> <a
              href="https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/cookies-und-website-daten-in-firefox-loschen" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">Delete cookies to remove data that websites have stored on your computer</a></li>
          <li><strong>Internet Explorer:</strong> <a

              target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delete and manage cookies</a></li>

              href="https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/topic/löschen-und-verwalten-von-cookies-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delete and manage cookies</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you fundamentally do not want any cookies, you can set up your browser to always notify you when a cookie
          is about to be set. This way, you can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow it or not. The
          procedure varies depending on the browser. It's best to search Google with the keyword "delete cookies Chrome"
          or "disable cookies Chrome" if you are using the Chrome browser.</p>

        <h4>Legal basis</h4>
        <p>Since 2009 there have been the so-called "cookie guidelines". It states that the storage of cookies requires
          your consent (Article 6 (1) lit. a GDPR). However, there are still very different reactions to these
          guidelines within EU countries. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in § 96 para. 3 of the
          Telecommunications Act (TKG). In Germany, the cookie guidelines were not implemented as national law. Instead,
          this directive was largely implemented in § 15 para.3 of the Telemedia Act (TMG).</p>

        <p>For essential cookies, even without consent, there are legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR),
          which in most cases are of an economic nature. We want to offer visitors to the website a pleasant user
          experience, and for this purpose, certain cookies are often essential.</p>

        <p>If cookies that are not absolutely necessary are used, this only happens if you give your consent. The legal
          basis is, in this case, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.</p>

        <p>In the following sections, you will be informed in more detail about the use of cookies, provided that the
          used software employs cookies.</p>


        <h4>Web Hosting</h4>

        <p><b>Web Hosting Summary</b><br>
          Affected: Visitors of the website<br>
          Purpose: Professional hosting of the website and securing its operation<br>
          Processed data: IP address, time of website visit, browser used, and other data. More details can be found
          below or with the respective web hosting provider.<br>
          Storage duration: Depends on the respective provider, but usually 2 weeks<br>
          Legal basis: Art. 6 Para. 1 lit.f GDPR (Legitimate Interests)</p>

        <h4>What is Web Hosting?</h4>

        <p>When you visit websites nowadays, certain information - including personal data - is automatically generated
          and stored, including on this website. This data should be processed as sparingly as possible and only with
          justification. By website, we mean the entirety of all pages on a domain, i.e., everything from the homepage
          to the very last subpage (like this one). By domain, we mean for example beispiel.de or musterbeispiel.com.
        </p>
        <p>If you want to view a website on a screen, you use a program called a web browser. You probably know some web
          browsers by name: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.</p>
        <p>This web browser must connect to another computer where the website's code is stored: the web server.
          Operating a web server is a complex and labor-intensive task, which is why it is usually taken over by
          professional providers, the hosting companies. They offer web hosting and ensure reliable and error-free
          storage of website data.</p>
        <p>When the browser on your computer (desktop, laptop, smartphone) connects and data is transferred to and from
          the web server, personal data can be processed. On the one hand, your computer stores data; on the other hand,
          the web server also needs to store data for a certain period to ensure smooth operation.</p>
        <h4>Why do we process personal data?</h4>
        <p>The purposes of data processing are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Professional hosting of the website and ensuring its operation</li>
          <li>Maintaining operational and IT security</li>
          <li>Anonymous analysis of user behavior to improve our offer and possibly for law enforcement or to pursue
            claims</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>What data is processed?</h4>

        <p>Even as you visit our website right now, our web server, the computer where this web page is stored, usually
          automatically saves data such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the complete internet address (URL) of the accessed website (e.g.,
            https://www.samplewebsite.com/samplesubpage.html?tid=311891618)</li>
          <li>Browser and browser version (e.g., Chrome 87)</li>
          <li>the operating system used (e.g., Windows 10)</li>
          <li>the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL) (e.g.,
            https://www.examplesourcesite.com/fromwhereicame.html/)</li>
          <li>the hostname and the IP address of the device accessing (e.g., COMPUTERNAME and 194.23.43.121)</li>
          <li>Date and time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is stored in files called web server log files.</p>

        <h4>How long is data stored?</h4>
        <p>As a rule, the data mentioned above is stored for two weeks and then automatically deleted. We do not share
          this data, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this data may be viewed by authorities in the event of
          illegal behavior.</p>
        <p>In short: Your visit is logged by our provider (the company that runs our website on specialized computers
          (servers)), but we do not share your data without your consent!</p>

        <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
        <p>The legality of processing personal data as part of web hosting is derived from Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR
          (Protection of legitimate interests), as using professional hosting with a provider is necessary to present
          the company securely and user-friendly on the internet and to be able to pursue attacks and claims arising
          from it if necessary.</p>
        <p>There is usually a contract between us and the hosting provider for order processing according to Art. 28 f.
          GDPR, which ensures compliance with data protection and guarantees data security.</p>
